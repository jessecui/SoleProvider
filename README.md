# SoleProvider documentation

## Overview
SoleProvider is a digital chatbot that allows for disadvantaged citizens such as the homeless to request needs.

This is the basic backend routing code for the SoleProvider chatbot that connects to Google Dialogflow and Twilio APIs using a Python Flask router.

## Needed API Keys
You will need two API accounts. One for Google Dialogflow and one for Twilio. The API tokens and account numbers are removed from the code for privacy purposes.
